# CSCD311 Class Project

## Residency Web App by Travis Brown (10755131)

### Instructions

- navigate to the root of this folder and run npm start in the console to start web application
- on any browser, go to <http://localhost:3000>


### Small things learned

- Makes it so a file is accessible by everybody `sudo chmod -R go+w /file_path`

- Allows me to kill a process at the specified port `lsof -nti:NumberOfPort | xargs kill -9`
  
- When console.logging Objects they print full contents if only the Obj but if so much as a string is in there with it. the Obj condenses to [object Object]
